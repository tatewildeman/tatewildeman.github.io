      <description>If you were a Duke basketball fan this year, it was most likely a tough year to watch. Duke basketball is known for having elite status in the Men’s college basketball world. However, this year did not go according to plan for Coach K and the boys. With 13 wins and 11 losses, this has been one of the worst records since Coach Krzyzewski has been at Duke. This is also the first time they have not made the NCAA tournament since the catastrophic 1994-1995 season.</description>
