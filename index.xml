      <description>Winning college basketball games is a challenging task to accomplish. But at the end of the day, that is what athletes and coaches are striving for. Teams are always looking for that advantage to put them over the top to win games and championships. Which leads me to my question, how do teams win college basketball games? It’s no secret, the team that wins the game scores more points than their opponent and holds the opposing team to fewer points.</description>

      <description>If you were a Duke basketball fan this year, it was most likely a tough year to watch. Duke basketball is known for having elite status in the Men’s college basketball world. However, this year did not go according to plan for Coach K and the boys. With 13 wins and 11 losses, this has been one of the worst records since Coach Krzyzewski has been at Duke. This is also the first time they have not made the NCAA tournament since the catastrophic 1994-1995 season.</description>
